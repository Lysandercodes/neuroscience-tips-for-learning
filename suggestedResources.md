## **Books for Adults About Learning**

_The Art of Changing the Brain: Enriching the Practice of Teaching by Exploring the Biology
of Learning_, by James E. Zull (Sterling, VA: Stylus Publishing, 2002).

_The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance_, by Josh Waitzkin
(New York: Free Press, 2008).

_Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_, by Cal Newport (New York:
Grand Central Publishing, 2016). Learning often involves being able to focus intently,
and Cal’s book gives great ideas along those lines.

_I Am Gifted, So Are You!_, by Adam Khoo (Singapore: Marshall Cavendish, 2014).
We love Adam’s personal story and practical insights.

_Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_, by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III,
and Mark A. McDaniel (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2014). One of our very
favorite books on learning for adults.

_A Mind for Numbers: How to Succeed in Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)_
by Barbara Oakley (New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2014). Even if we do say so ourselves,
this is actually a great general book on learning—it relates some of the ideas of
Learning How to Learn but from an adult prospective that includes many additional insights.

_Mindshift: Break Through Obstacles to Learning and Discover Your Hidden Potential_, by Barbara
Oakley (New York: TarcherPerigee, 2017). This book explores how you can change yourself through
learning—sometimes more than you might think!

_Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise_, by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool (New York:
Eamon Dolan/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016). Incidentally, what Anders calls a “mental
representation” is analogous to what we in Learning How to Learn call a “set of brain-links.”

_Remember It! The Names of People You Meet, All Your Passwords, Where You Left Your Keys,
and Everything Else You Tend to Forget_ by Nelson Dellis (New York: Abrams Image, 2018).
One of the best books on memory development for adults.
