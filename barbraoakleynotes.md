### Use These Diffuse Mode Tools as Rewards After Focused Mode Work

- if you find yourself stuck after at least ten to fifteen minutes of trying, it may be time for a break (Get into diffuse mode!) ## General Diffuse Mode Activators

                    - Play a sport like soccer or basketball
                    - Jog, walk, or swim
                    - Dance
                    - Enjoy being a passenger in a car or bus
                    - Ride a bike
                    - Draw or paint
                    - Take a bath or shower
                    - Listen to music, especially without words
                    - Play songs you know well on a musical instrument
                    - Meditate or pray
                    - Sleep (the ultimate diffuse mode!)

                   ## The following diffuse mode activators are best used briefly as rewards.                          These activities may pull you into a more focused mode than the preceding                          activities. It can sometimes be a good idea to set a timer, or they can eat up                      too much time.

                    - Play video games
                    - Talk to friendsHelp someone with a simple task
                    - Read a book
                    - Message friends
                    - Go see a movie (if you have the time!)
                    - Watch TV

### _Procrastination tips_

- a good mental trick is to tell yourself that you’re going to procrastinate ten minutes later.
  Meanwhile, during those ten minutes, look at (or make) a list of what you plan to do.
  This will allow your diffuse mode to start thinking in the background about
  your tasks and how you’re going to get them accomplished.

## The Three Key Steps to Powerful Reading

                                    1. Picture walk
                                    2. Read with care
                                    3. Use active recall

### _Reading tips_

- when you start a new chapter, go on a “picture walk”\* through it. Scan it.ii
  Look briefly at all the pictures, captions, and diagrams, but also at the section headings,
  bold words, and summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter, if the book has them.

--> **Active Recall**

- _This is the critical part. Look away from the page and see what you can recall.
  What are the key ideas on the page? Play them back in your mind. Or say them out loud
  to yourself. Do not simply reread the page over and over again.
  And don’t underline or highlight big amounts of text._

- _Recall the information at different times and in different places as frequently as desired._

## interesting fact: “neural reuse theory”

When you're using metaphors to learn a concept, you are reusing ideas you have already
learned to assist you in learning new ideas.

## Key Terms Related to Neuroscience

- **Axon**: An axon is like the “arm” of a neuron. It reaches out toward the next neuron
  in a set of brain-links.

- **Brain-links**: A set of brain-links is a term used in this book to indicate neurons that have
  become part of a team by frequent “sparks” across synapses. Learning something new means creating new brain-links.

- **Dendrite**: Dendrites are like the “legs” of a neuron. The dendritic spines on the dendrite
  receive signals from other neurons and can pass them along the dendrite toward the main
  body of the cell (the neuron-alien’s “eye”).

- **Dendritic spine**: Dendritic spines are the “toes” that stick out of a dendrite
  (a “leg” of the neuron). Dendritic spines form one side of a synaptic connection.

- **Diffuse mode**: We use the term diffuse mode to mean that certain parts of your brain become
  active when you’re resting and not thinking about anything in particular. (Neuroscientists
  call this the “default mode network,” the “task negative network,” or the
  “activation of neural resting states.”)

- **Focused mode**: We use the term focused mode to mean that certain parts of your brain go to
  work when you pay close attention to something. When you are focusing, the active parts of your
  brain are mostly different from those parts that are active in the diffuse mode. (Instead of
  “focused mode,” neuroscientists use the heavy-duty term “activation of task positive networks.”)

- **Neuron**: Neurons are tiny cells that are key building blocks of your brain. Your thoughts
  are formed by electrical signals that travel through neurons. In this book, we say that
  a neuron has “legs” (dendrites) and an “arm” (an axon), almost like a space alien.
  An electrical signal can travel from the neuron’s legs to its arm, where it can “shock”
  the next neuron in a set of links.

- **Neuroplasticity**: The fact that trails in your brain can change and grow is called
  neuroplasticity. Your neurons are like plastic clay you can mold.
  You can change your brain through learning!

- **Synapse**: A synapse is a special, very narrow gap between neurons. Electrical signals
  (your thoughts) can jump across this gap with the help of certain chemicals.
  When we say a “stronger synapse,” we mean that the effect of the signal jumping
  across the gap is stronger.

---

When you haven’t linked the material, you can feel confused.
Like you just can’t grasp it. Of course that’s not true at all. You just need to
start by building some little sets of brain-links. With practice, little brain-links
become longer ones. Your octopus can pull them right up and work easily with them.
The earliest steps of learning something new are often the hardest. Make a library of sets
of brain-links, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming an expert.

---

## Key Terms Related to Psychology

- **Active learning**: Active learning means actively practicing or doing something yourself to
  bring what you are learning to life. Watching other people, looking at a solution,
  or reading a page can help you get started. But it won’t do much to build your own
  neural structures of learning. Only actively working with the materials will help
  you build strong brain-links.

- **Active recall**: Active recall means bringing an idea back to mind,
  preferably without any notes or book in front of you.
  Simply recalling key ideas you are learning has been shown to be a great way to understand them.

- **Amnesia**: Amnesia is the inability to remember new facts or events in your life.

- **Cognitive load**: Cognitive load means how much mental effort is being used in the working
  memory. If you have too big a cognitive load because you are being presented with too many new
  ideas at once, you can’t take in new information very easily.

- **Deliberate practice**: Deliberate practice means focusing on the material that’s most difficult
  for you. The opposite is “lazy learning”—repeatedly practicing what’s easiest.

- **Fact memory**: We use the term fact to indicate a category of memory that is more abstract.
  Facts can be harder to store in long-term memory than pictures. (Psychologists call these
  types of long-term memories that are common knowledge, such as the names of colors and
  other basic facts acquired over a lifetime, “semantic” memory.)

- **Interleaving**: Interleaving means practicing different aspects of what you are trying to
  learn so you understand the differences between the techniques. Chapter 4 in your algebra
  textbook may introduce you to one set of problem-solving techniques, while chapter 5 introduces
  you to a different set of problem-solving techniques. Interleaving means alternating between
  chapter 4– and chapter 5–type problems so you can see when to use the two different techniques.

- **Long-term memory**: Long-term memory is like your brain’s “locker”—a long-term storage space
  for memories. You can store lots of information in your long-term memory. Sets of brain-links
  are stored in long-term memory.

- **Picture memory**: We use the term picture memory to mean a category of memories that involves
  pictures. Pictures are easier to store in your long-term memory than facts.
  (Psychologists call picture memory “episodic” memory.)

- **Working memory**: Working memory is your brain’s temporary storage space. You can think of
  working memory as being like an octopus with only four arms. This is because you can hold
  about four items at once in your working memory. “Arms” of your working memory can
  reach down into your long-term memory to connect with sets of brain-links you have created there.

# Test Preparation Checklist

**Answer “Yes” only if you usually do these things:**

1. Did you get a reasonable night’s sleep before the test? (If your answer is “No,”
   then your answers to the rest of the questions may not matter.) [Y/N]

2. Did you review your notes from class not long after you took them? Did you use active recall
   during your review to see if you could easily pull to mind the key ideas? [Y/N]

3. Did you study a little bit on most days instead of waiting until the last minute and
   cramming right before the test? [Y/N]

4. Did you focus carefully during your study sessions, doing your best to avoid distractions
   except when you were taking a break? [Y/N]

5. Did you study in different locations? [Y/N]

6. Did you read your textbook or class worksheets carefully? (Just fishing around for the answer
   to what you’re working on doesn’t count.) While you were reading, did you avoid too much
   underlining and highlighting your textbook? Did you make brief notes about the book’s key
   ideas and then look away to see if you could recall them? [Y/N]

7. If your studies involved working problems, did you actively work and rework key examples by you-
   rself, so you turned them into sets of brain-links and could rapidly call the solution to mind?
   [Y/N]

8. Did you discuss homework problems with classmates, or at least check your solutions with others?
   [Y/N]

9. Did you actively work every homework problem yourself? [Y/N]

10. Did you talk to your teachers, or to other students who could help, when you were having
    trouble with your understanding? [Y/N]

11. Did you spend most of your study time focusing on the material you found harder? That is,
    did you do deliberate practice? [Y/N]

12. Did you interleave your studies? In other words, did you practice when
    to use different techniques? [Y/N]

13. Did you explain key ideas to yourself, and perhaps to others, using funny metaphors and images?
    [Y/N]

14. Did you take occasional breaks from your studies that included some physical activity? [Y/N]

# _SUMMARIES_

## CHAPTER 2: EASY DOES IT

**Focused and diffuse modes**. Our brains operate in two modes: focused and diffuse. You can think
of them as pinball tables that have tightly packed bumpers and spread- out bumpers. We need to
alternate between these two modes to learn well.

**Shifting modes**. You shift into focused mode by focusing. Grab those flippers on the pinball
machine! But you have to let go and wait for the ball to drop on its own to get into the diffuse
mode. The bed, the bath, the bus, and simply going for a walk are great ways to fall
into the diffuse mode.

**To be a successful problem solver, focus first.** We get stuck in problem solving when we don’t
first prepare our brain by focusing on the basics. Don’t just dive into problem solving without
studying the explanations first. You need to lay some basic trails on the focused pinball table.

**Take breaks to get new problem-solving perspectives.** We can also get stuck on a difficult
problem even when we’ve prepared properly. In that case, be a little like the chess-playing Magnus.
Wander off for a while and see what else is going on. Take a break. But come back to the game,
or you’ll lose for sure!

---

## CHAPTER 3: I’LL DO IT LATER, HONEST!

We all develop habits. They’re our inner zombies. Things we do without even thinking about them.

**Our zombie habits can be helpful or not**. Some are great time savers. But often people develop
the habit of putting off their work—procrastination. This is really bad for effective learning. It
doesn’t leave you enough time to focus or to soak in the lessons you’ve learned.

Luckily you can change your habits and make them stick. **The Pomodoro Technique is a great way of
helping you to do focused work**. Make a habit of it. Shut off distractions and set a timer to work
for 25 minutes. Easy. Then take a break and reward yourself. Do something “diffuse.”

**When you put something off, it’s hurting your brain**. Just getting going stops the suffering.

**Active recall is a powerful technique for learning**. Pull key ideas from your own mind to review
them. Don’t just look at a page or your notes and fool yourself into thinking that the information
is in your head.

---

## CHAPTER 4: BRAIN-LINKS AND FUN WITH SPACE ALIENS

Neurons send **signals** that flow through your brain. These signals are your thoughts.

Neurons have a distinctive look, almost like space aliens. There are **dendrites** (“legs”) on one
side of the neuron and an **axon** (“arm”) on the other.

**Dendritic spines** are like “toes” on a neuron’s “legs.”

**The axon of one neuron “shocks” a dendritic spine on the next neuron**.
This is how one neuronsends a signal to the next neuron.

**The word synapse refers to the special narrow gap where the axon and the dendritic spine are
nearly touching one another**. A “spark” is sent from the axon to the dendritic spine.

**Metaphors are powerful learning tools**. They help us reuse neuron trails we have already
developed so that we can learn more quickly.

**If a metaphor is no longer useful, throw it away and get a new one**.

In our book, we point out that a set of brain-links (or mouse paths) can grow stronger in two ways:

- **Each synapse gets bigger**, so each spark is stronger.
- **More neurons join in**, so there are more synapses.

**You strengthen your brain-links (or mouse paths) by practicing**.

It’s easy to come up with excuses for why good learning techniques aren’t for you.
**It’s important to challenge these excuses**.

**Even kids who start out badly at school can turn things around and end up being successful**.
Remember Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience!

---

## CHAPTER 5: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEACHER’S DESK

**It’s possible to learn new subjects that you never thought you could learn**. You can do this even when you are an adult!

**Learning about new subjects can empower you**.

**Use tools like the Pomodoro and active recall, and be sure to exercise** (you’ll learn more about that soon!) to boost your learning.

**Check the internet** for other explanations if the first explanation doesn’t make sense to you.

**Ask other people for help when you are stuck**.

**Don’t be afraid to go back to a beginner’s level**, even if you are older than other students.

---

## CHAPTER 6: LEARNING WHILE YOU SLEEP

New dendritic spines and synapses begin to form when you start learning new information. But
**the dendritic spines and synapses really develop after your focused learning session**, while you
are sleeping that night.

**Sleep provides the “mortar” that solidifies the walls of your learning**.

Dendritic spines and synapses develop even further when you continue to practice what you are
learning. **The more you send a thought around your neural pathways, the more permanent it
becomes**. That’s how sets of brain-links are made.

**Don’t cram**. Space out your learning over several days. That way you’ll have more nights of
sleep for more dendritic spines and synapses to grow. Your lessons will sink in.

**We all learn at different speeds**. Don’t feel bad if someone else is quicker than you.
That’s life. Just put in a little more time. You’ll also soon discover that being a “slow” learner
can give you special advantages.

---

## CHAPTER 7: SCHOOL BAGS, LOCKERS ,AND YOUR ATTENTIONAL OCTOPUS

You have **two memory systems**: working memory and long-term memory.

**Working memory** involves what you are consciously thinking about at that moment.

The working memory system is largely in your prefrontal cortex.

You can imagine that your working memory is like a friendly “attentional octopus” who
generally has four arms. **Having only four arms explains why your working memory holds
only a limited amount of information**.

**Long-term memory** is scattered around in your brain. You have to “reach” for it with the arms of
your attentional octopus. Your long-term memory has almost never-ending storage space.
But you need to harness it through practice and process.

---

## CHAPTER 8: SLICK TRICKS TO BUILD YOUR MEMORY

Information is stored in memory as two types **facts and pictures**. Pictures are much easier to remember.

Nelson Dellis’s five memory tips are:

1. **Focus** on what you’re trying to remember.
2. **Practice** remembering.
3. **Turn** what you are trying to remember into a **picture**.
4. **Store** the picture by connecting it to things you already know.
5. **Use active recall** to make the idea stick.

   **Memory palaces are useful**, because they use your
   amazing visuospatial powers. Practice using your
   memory, and it will get easier and easier.

Five other ways to help you remember are to:

1. **Use** a **song**.
2. **Make** up **metaphors**.
3. **Take good notes**, preferably handwritten.
4. **Imagine** you are the thing you’re trying to understand and remember.
5. **Share your ideas**. Teach them to someone else.

---

## CHAPTER 9: WHY BRAIN-LINKS ARE IMPORTANT

**A set of brain-links is a pathway of connected neurons in your long-term “locker” memory that is
built through practice. A set of brain-links helps your working memory to process information more
quickly**. Brain-links like these are easy for your attentional octopus to grab on to.

Your octopus gets tired if it has to keep switching its focus from one set of brain-links to a
completely different one. **So try to avoid distraction and task switching**.

Without sets of brain-links, we get confused when we try to put too much into our mental
school bag. **We all have a maximum cognitive load**. There is a limit to what we can deal
with at one time in our working memory.

**The earliest steps of learning something new are often the hardest**. Be patient and keep working
away. Look for that click of delightful enjoyment as a set of brain-links begins to form and you
“get” how to do something.

---

## CHAPTER 10: LEARNING WITH CLUBS AND GROUPS, FINDING YOUR MISSION, AND HOW TERRY NEARLY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL

**Find something that really grabs your interest at school**. Find your own version of radio club.

**Don’t be afraid to ask**. If your school doesn’t have activities that interest you,
ask them to set something up. Or you can start a club yourself with some help from the school.

**Be ready to work with others**. Hang out with creative people and see how many more ideas you
start to have yourself.

**Make your learning active whenever you can**. Put things you learn from books into practice,
as well as reading about them.

**Be amazed by your brain**! It’s as if you have billions of tiny computers all working together
for you.

**Learning in one area can give you more ideas in other areas**. Subjects connect.
Physics can help with biology. And it might even help with art, sports, or making friends!

---

## CHAPTER 11: HOW TO PUMP UP YOUR BRAIN

**You can learn from the internet, as well as from teachers and books**.

**Exercise is really good for your neurons**, especially the new ones.

Exercise helps create a chemical (BDNF) that is like **food for your brain**.

**Exercise releases chemicals that generate new ideas**.

**Exercise is a great diffuse activity**!

---

## CHAPTER 12: MAKING BRAIN-LINKS

Looking at a solution or watching someone else practice can get you started in learning
something new. But just looking or watching doesn’t build yourbrain-links. **Actively working
through a problem, or doing an activity, is what creates brain-links**.

**You create and strengthen sets of brain-links through deliberate practice**. That’s focused,
repeated work on the more difficult parts of a concept. Don’t waste much time on the easy
stuff that you already know.

**Interleaving is the other important part of making an expert set of brain-links**.
Switch around within a subject. This will give you a sense of the topic as a whole.
Your neurons will eventually link up and you’ll have completed a whole “puzzle.”

**Practice active recall**. Test yourself. Have someone else test you.

**Teach your mom or dad or friend about an idea you find difficult**. Try to do this without notes.
This is one of the best ways to strengthen your brain-links and will also make you realize where
you have gaps in your knowledge.

Remember what you learned in the first chapter—**go on picture walks**. This gets your mind ready
for what it’s about to work on.

---

## CHAPTER 13: ASKING YOURSELF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

Everybody’s different. That’s why it’s important to **become your own personal learning
scientist**. You can see what works best in your learning. Think like a scientist and start
looking for patterns in what works and what doesn’t work for you.

Music can be either helpful or harmful when it comes to learning.
Look “from the ceiling” at how music affects your studies.

**Study in different places when you can**. This allows your attentional octopus to
be comfortable when it takes a test in a room that’s not the one you studied in.

**Try to learn using a variety of senses**. Your eyes, your ears, your hands—even
your nose can help you learn. You learn best when you use all your senses.

Sleep not only helps build new synaptic connections— it also washes away toxins!

**Eat your frogs first**. Start with the harder materials first so you can take
a break and use diffuse mode if you need to.

When you can, set a firm daily **quitting time** to allow you to concentrate more intently
when you are working.

---

## CHAPTER 14: LEARNING SURPRISES

**Action video games can improve your ability to focus**. They can also improve your vision.
They can be especially useful for older people, to help keep their focus strong.

**Spatial video games can improve your ability to rotate objects mentally—an important skill in
math and science**.

One drawback of video games is that, like any other pleasurable activity, they can become
**addictive**. Use common sense to avoid overdoing it.

**To build your mental flexibility, learn about something completely different from your passion**.
You’ll see links that lead to creative new ideas, which help with your passion.
Learning something very different also helps you to avoid “rut think.”

**Take notes by hand**. It enables you to make brain- links out of the key ideas more easily.

**A poor working memory can be a good thing**. It can allow you to:

- See elegant simplifications that others miss.
- Be more creative.

**“Slow” thinkers can understand a subject or problem just as well as “fast” thinkers**.
Slow thinkers may need more time, but they can sometimesactually understand the subject better than
fast thinkers.

---

## CHAPTER 15 HOW TO DO WELL ON TESTS

Use a **test preparation checklist** to make sure you are preparing properly for tests.

Use the **hard-start technique**. If you’ve studied well for a test, start the test with
a hard problem. Then pull yourself away when you find you are getting stuck and work on another,
easier problem. You can go back to work on the harder problem again later in the test.
You can often make more progress than if you tackled the hard problem at the end of the test,
when you have little time.

Your body releases chemicals when you’re excited or nervous. **How you interpret your feelings
makes a difference**. If you shift your thinking from “This test has made me afraid”
to “This test has got me excited to do my best!” it can improve your performance.

**Breathe deeply from the belly** for a few breaths if you feel panicky before or during a test.

**It’s easy to make mistakes on a test**. Your mind can trick you into thinking that what you’ve
done is correct, even if it isn’t. This means that, whenever possible, you should blink,
shift your attention, and then double-check your answers using a big-picture perspective,
asking yourself, “Does this really make sense?” Try to review the problems
in a different order from when you first completed them.

Whatever else you do, get the best **sleep** as you can before a test.

---

## CHAPTER 16: GOING FROM “HAVE TO” TO “GET TO”

barb's summary:

1. Make use of both the intense **focused** and relaxed **diffuse** modes. If you are
   getting frustrated, it’s time to switch to another topic. Or get some physical exercise!

2. **Create sets of brain-links** with practice, repetition, and recall.
   Practice important problems so you can easily recall each step. Solutions, concepts,
   and techniques should flow like songs in your mind.

3. **Interleave**. Don’t just keep practicing with slight changes in the same basic technique.
   Switch back and forth between different techniques. This will allow you to see _when_ to use
   a technique. Books usually don’t help you interleave. You will have
   to practice skipping back and forth between the ideas in different chapters yourself.

4. **Space out your learning**. Practice over at least several days.
   This gives time for your new synapses to form.

5. **Exercise!** Exercise feeds your neurons. It also allows you to grow new and stronger synapses.

6. **Test** yourself. Have others test you. Teach others. All of these are related to _recall_.
   Testing and recall are the best ways to strengthen your learning.

7. Use **funny pictures and metaphors** to speed your learning. Start using memory palaces.

8. Use the **Pomodoro Technique** to build your ability to focus and relax.
   Just turn off all distractions, set the timer to 25 minutes, focus, and then reward yourself.

9. **Eat your frogs first**. Start your most difficult work first.
   That way you can either finish it or take a break to let your diffuse mode help you.

10. **Find ways to learn actively, outside of your usual classes.** Look online
    for other explanations. Read other books. Join a club.
    If you don’t find a club in the subject that interests you, see if you can start one.

---

And here are ten pitfalls to avoid in your learning:

1. **Not getting enough sleep**. Sleep makes your brain-links stronger.
   It washes away toxins in your brain. If you don’t get a good night’s sleep before a test,
   _nothing else you have done will matter_.

2. **Passive reading and rereading**. You need to practice active recall,
   not just let your eyes pass over the same material.

3. **Highlighting or underlining**. Don’t be fooled! Just highlighting or underlining
   big chunks of text doesn’t put anything in your head. Make brief notes about the
   key concepts you are reading. Do this in the margin or on a piece of paper.
   These notes help you create _brain-links_ of the key concepts.

4. **Glancing at the solution to a problem** and thinking you understand it.
   You need to solve the problem yourself.

5. **Cramming**. Last-minute learning doesn’t build solid brain- links.

6. **Lazy learning**. Don’t just practice easy material. That’s like
   learning to play basketball by focusing on
   your dribbling. Use _deliberate practice_—focus on what you find most difficult.

7. **Ignoring your book**. If you are using a textbook in your studies,
   remember to take a picture walk through your book or course notes before you get going.
   And be _sure_ to read about how to do problems before trying to _solve_ problems!

8. **Not clearing up points of confusion**. Are there just a few points you don’t get?
   Chances are, these are precisely the points that will be asked about on the test.
   Be sure to get help from your teacher or your friends.

9. **Distractions**. Choose somewhere you can focus when you study.
   It’s often a good idea to leave your smartphone turned off and out of reach.

10. **Chatting with friends instead of studying with them**. Good study groups can be a great
    way to help you learn. But“study groups” that mostly gossip instead of study aren’t much use.
